    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3> Insurance claim fraud detecTon using Supervised Learning. <span style="font-weight: normal;">{Python, Numoy, Matlplotlib, Seaborn}</span></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The focus of this project is to detect the behavior of fraud insurance claims by analyzing the details filled by people
            during the claim.</li>
        <li>Employed Logistic Regression and SVM creating two class distributions and our results show that SVM has the best
            fraud detection performance and low false negative rates performance compared to Logistic Regression.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Lane Detection using CV for Self-Driving Cars. <span style="font-weight: normal;"> {OpenCv, Tensorflow, flask, Keras}</span></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The aim of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end lane detection method using computer vision techniques for self-driving cars.</li>
        <li>We adopted a lane detection technique based on perspective transformaOons and histogram analysis to detect both straight and curved lane lines that can help guide self-driving cars.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Covid-19 cases prediction for the next 30 days. <span style="font-weight: normal;"> {pandas, numpy, Hprophet, sklearn}</span></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed an algorithm to predict number of covid cases over the world in the next 30 days using Facebook prophet
            model.</li>
        <li>This Time series model for predic[on of epidemics, gives a forecast value and bound range of covid-19 cases every
            day for the next 30 days with good accuracy.</li>
